    <h3 id="language">What Is Python?</h3>
    <p class="para">First released in 1991, Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used in a range of applications, including data science, software development, and automation. According to Python.org, Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 

        The programming language has been notably used to create Netflix’s recommendation algorithm and software that controls self-driving cars, according to an article by Coursera. The Python interpreter and standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site.
        
        A fun fact about Python, creator Guido van Rossum came up with the name while reading published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”.</p>
        <h3 id="language">What Is HTML?</h3>
        <p class="center large">Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a coding language used to build websites. Specifically, HTML’s job is to label and organize content such as headings, paragraphs, lists and images, so that the web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, etc.) knows how the page should look.</p>
        <h3 id="language">What Is CSS?</h3>
        <p class="para">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a coding language that pairs with HTML. It works by defining a series of rules for how the HTML should look (colors, spacing, etc). CSS is helpful for establishing the layout and personality of a website.</p>
        <h3 id="language">What Is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p class="para">JavaScript (JS) can be combined with HTML/CSS to bring websites to life. JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can be used for animation, dynamic apps, interactive games and more.</p>

    <p>Why BSD Uses JS And HTML/CSS</p>
    <p>At BSD Education, we feel strongly that any type of coding and digital skills instruction is vital to a student’s education and future in navigating our digital world.</p>
    <div>
        <p>We have chosen the front-end stack as a part of our digital skills curriculum because it satisfies a range of interests, including design, layout, functionality, UI/UX, gaming, AI and VR. </p>
        <p>By learning three languages together to develop more interests, and ultimately more skills, students are provided a more complete learning experience that learning one language can’t match.</p>
        <section>
            <p>When the question comes up, “which is better, Python or JavaScript?”, it really depends on what kind of computing tasks you might be interested in doing.</p>
        </section>
    </div>
    <p>This broad range of skills stretches beyond the keyboard and includes key computational thinking and critical thinking skills vital to learning in any other core subject.</p>
    <p>In addition, when we think about the most powerful technologies that we use everyday, most of them operate in the web browser, which is what HTML/CSS and JavaScript are used for. Every website and web application that you have ever used were made using this front-end stack. </p>
    <div>
        <p>f students are interested in becoming computer scientists, they may need to learn Java, Python, JavaScript, or other languages depending on the accreditation program. </p>
        <p>For example, Java has been the language of choice for the Advanced Placement college equivalent course that is available in many High Schools in the U.S. </p>
